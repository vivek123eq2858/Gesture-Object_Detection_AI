# Gesture-Object_Detection_AI 🤖🖐️📦

An intelligent AI system that combines **gesture recognition** with **object detection** to form meaningful sentences — ideal for assistive technology, smart classrooms, or gesture-driven interfaces.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Recognizes custom hand/body gestures using MediaPipe and LSTM
- 🔍 Detects objects in real-time using YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- 💬 Automatically forms sentences from gesture + object context
- ⚡ Optimized with multithreading for faster recognition
- 🔁 Press `R` to reset the current sentence
- 📹 Real-time webcam GUI

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **TensorFlow / Keras (LSTM model)**
- **OpenCV**
- **MediaPipe**
- **Ultralytics YOLOv8**
- **Tkinter GUI (for real-time interaction)**

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vivek123eq2858/Gesture-Object_Detection_AI.git
   cd Gesture-Object_Detection_AI
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the main app**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **(Optional)** Record new gestures

   ```bash
   python record_gesture.py
   ```
